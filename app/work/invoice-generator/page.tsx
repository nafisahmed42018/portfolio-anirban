            Our goal was to efficiently let business owners manage their sales
            and customers and achieve a complete oversight on their businesses.
            We aimed to simplify invoicing and transaction tracking, making it
            easier to monitor cash flow and business performance. By integrating
            customer management, businesses can keep records of client
            interactions and payment histories. The inventory system ensures
            better stock control, reducing errors and improving efficiency.
            Overall, the purpose was to create a seamless system that helps
            businesses stay organized, make informed decisions, and save time on
            administrative tasks.

        <ProjectPara title="Problem">
          <p>
            Problem with the invoice generators in market is that they are
            single purpose, hence the users jump from one to another for their
            specific requirements in invoices. What we though out is to make the
            app more general purpose. Letting users insert and manipulate any
            information that they find necessary to do so. <br /> <br />
            Another issue we noticed is that businesses struggle to keep track
            of their sales and inventory. Limited customization options make it
            harder for users to create invoices that fit their specific needs.
            On top of that, poor data organization and transaction tracking in
            existing solutions make it difficult to get a clear financial
            picture. These gaps not only add unnecessary complexity but also
            waste valuable timeâ€”problems we aimed to solve.

          <p>
            A double-diamond approach was chosen throughout the design phases.
            It is because Ideas had to be explored for covering the vast amount
            of general purpose users and their use cases. Alongside that the
            proper analyses that a user may require can be rather complicated.
            Which is why, a divergent approaches gave us more room to
            incorporate probable solutions for different business perspectives.

            The background product research was primarily conducted by the
            product team at SOFTEKO. Since this was an Exact Match Domain (EMD)
            web app, an SEO-based approach was incorporated. The team gathered
            resources such as competitors, keywords, and frameworks to generate
            a topical map for the project. They then assessed user needs to form
            a basic idea of the MVP. The details of the research work can be

            <br /> From my end, I had the opportunity to assess the requirements
            and collaborate with the product analysis team to create a Product
            Requirements Document (PRD) for the project. This process helped me
            gather features and distribute my work efficiently. By creating a
            persona, I analyzed a business's sales and their impact on inventory
            stocks. Later, I simulated a Customer Journey Map (CJM) to identify
            shelving problems. <br />

          <p>
          Another aspect of my research involved studying competitors. In this case, 
          our main competitors were Zoho, Wise, and Invoice Simple. After using these 
          invoice makers, I gathered some findings.<br />
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
            None of the competitors (Zoho, Wise, Invoice Simple) included a product tracking system.
            </li><li>
            Since products have varying units and currencies, a conversion system is 
            essential when attaching them to invoices.
            </li><li>
            Zoho and Wise offered very restricted layout customization options, making 
            it difficult for users to adjust invoices to their branding needs.
            </li><li>
            The free versions of these platforms provided only a few templates, which 
            limited design flexibility and forced users to settle for predefined formats.
            </li><li>
            Invoice Simple only allowed users to apply either a flat value or a percentage
            -based discount or tax, with no option to combine both.
            </li><li>
            Zoho provided field customization, but it also introduced data type mismatches 
            when users renamed fields. This lack of integrity led to potential errors in 
            calculations or invoice structuring.

          <p>
          We have chosen a professional Gunmetal blue to pan out our invoices color scheme. 
          The whole theme was catered to cooler color temperature, and branded on that purpose. 
          With which the an orange accent (Fire Opal) made the components stand out.<br />

          Following is the Grid system that we thought works well with our invoice layout and 
          dashboard. A 12 column grid system is maintained throughout the design. In the 
          Dashboard a consistent 300px of width is reserved for the sidebar, which on smaller 
          screens can be shrunk and/or hidden.<br />
          <br />
          We also accommodated 300px wide ad spaces in both sides of the tool page. It is to 
          be noted that the following dimensions are for a 1920x1080 screen device and sizes 
          were adjusted on smaller devices.<br />

            Typography
          </h5>
          <p>
          A modern and clear Sans-serif font, Metro Sans was chosen for recognizability and 
          maintaining a professional look. The main focus was to keep all the elements organized 
          and polished. So that the businesses it caters to can identify and utilize it well.<br />
          <br />
          The following Type scale was chosen to keep the look and feel of the site organized. 
          The scale provided enough legibility, alongside proper form factor to utilize in smaller

          The Information architecture organizes key features, making the invoice generator intuitive 
          and efficient, so users can navigate and formulate tasks with ease. The special focuses 
          were on the individual form elements and attachments that the invoice were built around.<br />
          <br />
          We made a User flow of the tool section which led us to customize our available choices 
          and what we can allow users. While the process follows a linear structure, much of it 
          depends on the user's choice of tools.<br />

          After completing our visions We went ahead and sketched out wireframes for the invoice generator.<br />

          A low fidelity wireframe was first drawn. From where we created a few mid-fidelity screens 
          to adjust Layouts and parameters. As our information architecture and the schemas were ready, 
          we could figure out important data values that should be presented to the user for appropriate

          The dashboard primarily serves as storage for attachments such as products, 
          customers, and payment methods used in invoices. The transaction pages acts 
          as a tracker for payments, which are then reflected in the analytics page. 
          Depending on whether an invoice is paid or unpaid, it is stored in either 
          the "Received" or "Paid" section.<br />
          <br />
          The Sales section gives a clear breakdown of all products and customers 
          managed within the dashboard. Users can review sales and revenue history, 
          analyze profits, and identify top-performing products. Additionally, they 
          can monitor the status of their invoices, including paid and overdue ones.<br />

          The Inventory and Analytics pages are exclusive to premium users. There is 
          a specific relation between the inventory and the Products pageâ€”when products 
          are stocked in the inventory, they are automatically added to the product 
          database. This creates product states, where availability is either tracked 
          or untracked. And when these products are used in invoices, the stock levels 
          automatically adjust for those marked as "Tracked."<br />

          An invoice generator is managed through various input fields. We have thought
