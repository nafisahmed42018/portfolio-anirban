Clients will be able to submit their project requirements and the team will work collaboratively to provide innovative solutions.

          Now unlike any other project I've previously worked on, Oxfo is led to be 
          a solution provider. Let's zoom into that for a bit. It's a platform that 
          is run by the projects that clients want them to build. It can be as small 
          as a generic media graphic, or as large as a giant scale E-commerce with 
          inventory management. As there were a plethora of web based services associated 
          with it, you bet the end users are going to be diverse.<br />
          <br />
          For that we would require a much more eye-pleasing and bouncy, colorful 
          design with vibrant and contrasted elements that would help any user feel welcome.<br />

          The research process began even before Oxfo was conceptualized. With an in-house team 
          already in place at Safewheel, our founders always aspired to be solution providers. 
          With the perspective of true entrepreneurs, they saw this amazing opportunity and couldn't 
          let it slip away. As for this new project, I was fortunate enough to be selected as the 
          Deputy Manager, overseeing the entire process from start to finish. <br />
          <br />
          Now, the first thing was to assess what the team was capable of and determine the types 
          of services we could provide. To do this, I needed to create a Business Model Canvas. 
          After several meetings, collaborations, and consultations with each team member, I ended 
          up with the following canvas. <br />

          I have studied nearly <span className="font-medium">17 different solution provider </span> 
          platforms, taking notes from each of them and auditing them in my personal archive. I have 
          compiled a documented list that is available at the following link. <br />

          From the data I collected, I created an ideal user flow as how I imagined the website to

            Marketing Plan

          <p>
          I was also lucky enough to plan the marketing strategy for Oxfo. Scouring through LinkedIn 
          I've came to the conclusion that people require informative posts and blogs to be convinced 
          in a platform. <br />
          <br />
          This insight prompted me to collaborate with <span className="font-medium">Rafiq Islam</span> and 
          <span className="font-medium">Ariful Islam Muhin</span> on several blogs. Following this, we 
          created numerous flyers and informative posters. <br />

            Research
          </h5>
          <p>
          As I mentioned before, the Oxfo team will be working with a diverse group of people. Therefore, 
          it was crucial to make the branding less intimidating. During my research, I found that many 
          agencies and solution providers either make their websites overly complicated with large, flashy 
          fonts and complex animations, or they make them too simple and lacking in information. <br />
          <br />
          For this reason, I wanted to create a website that provides proper documentation to assure clients 
          of our services. I believe that using larger texts and whitespace will give the website a minimalistic feel. <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, I wanted to select a font that is not commonly used on other websites, but still 
          serves as an excellent replacement for technology-focused websites. This led me to consider a 
          Sans-serif font.
          <br />
          In addition to establishing our identity, I believe it is important for users to see examples of 
          the team's previous work. This will help them feel confident that they have chosen the right team 
          to bring their ideas to life.
          </p>
          <h5 className=" text-monochrome110 font-semibold text-xl">
            Process
          </h5>
          <p>
          So, taking a note from the research, I have chosen a color palette that is easy on the eyes and 
          provides contrast to make it eye-catching. For the background, I've selected a light theme with 
          white as the background color. <br />
          <br />
          To add shades to the background, I've chosen the main color as Bleached Aqua, which gives a cool 
          and light effect when designing the components. The color Autumn Robin is used to highlight 
          important text and CTA buttons, as it is vibrant and exciting. Finally, a Yellow Mustard color 
          is used as an accent for its warmth, friendliness, and optimism.
          <br />
          For texts and contents, a dark Eclipse color and its shades will work wonders. The peacock color 
          is included to contrast the beautifully accented Mustard. <br />
          </p>

          <p>
          When it comes to the logo, I had several ideas in mind. Eventually, I collaborated with my colleague 
          Ema, who provided me with a few sketches. After tinkering with the "O" of Oxfo, we realized it was our 
          best option. The brand name generated a lot of hype, and the "O" is the most significant part of it. 
          For a clean design, we opted for a simple gradient. Although the company is a tech company, users have 
          noted that the snipped "O" logo resembles a doorway or a hint of a lightbulb. Aesthetically, I aimed 
          to create a brand that stands out from the more technical tool-facing marketplace. <br />
          <br />
          The rest of the logo consists of other letters, with the Oxfo portion highlighted. <br />

          how I might solve those problems. I got down to pen and paper, sketching quick low fidelity wireframes. <br />
