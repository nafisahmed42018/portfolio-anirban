    "Taking care of a loved one or managing multiple patients can be overwhelming. We struggle with keeping track of medications, appointments, and daily tasks, often leading to stress and missed care. In Bangladesh, connecting to suitable & reliable caregivers can be such a daunting task. The Caregiver App was created to make life easier for both family and professional caregivers. Inspired by real experiences, it aims to simplify care by helping families find qualified caregivers while also providing training and resources for those who want to enter the field. By combining education and employment opportunities in one platform, the app makes caregiving more accessible, professional, and rewarding for everyone involved.",

            Finding and training caregivers is often a difficult and
            unstructured process. In Bangladesh, even in cities families
            struggle to connect with qualified caregivers due to scarcity, while
            aspiring ones lack accessible training and job opportunities.
            Especially involvement of third parties & brokers in the market
            increases costs and reduces transparency, making the bridging even
            more challenging. Inconsistent skill levels, high turnover rates,
            and a lack of proper support for both caregivers and seekers further
            complicate the caregiving landscape.

            For a widespread application, user engagement was a crucial part of
            the research. Since there was already an existing user base, I had
            the opportunity to conduct interviews. I started the interview from
            my own house. And eventually extended It’s spread to a few dedicated
            users that knew and loved Songjog’s services. Additionally, a quick
            Reddit post allowed me to gather valuable insights from a global
            audience, providing a broader perspective on user needs and
            expectations.

            After conducting several moderated interview and survey sessions, we
            developed an empathy map. Since we had two to three different types
            of users, we ensured that their key interests and concerns were
            incorporated. Additionally, we identified their pain points and
            potential benefits, which we summarized in the Pains & Gains
            section.

            After conducting several rounds of surveys, user interviews, and
            analyzing the data, we identified the following issues preventing
            users from locating suitable caregivers.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Users rely on word-of-mouth or informal networks, making it
                  difficult to find caregivers quickly. 73% of respondents said
                  they had to ask friends or family for recommendations.

                  Communication was limited, making it hard for users to explain
                  needs; caregivers lacked context on recipients. Researching
                  pre-consultation forms could help admins in this case.

            Based on the responses and summaries, it was still somewhat unclear
            how the application would function in practice. Many processes were
            manually controlled, making an admin panel essential for effective
            moderation. That’s why, after mapping the Customer Journey, we
            decided to take it a step further and develop a Service Blueprint to
            clearly define the interactions, roles, and system dependencies.
            <br />

            Throughout the process, we went through multiple iterations as
            requirements and client expectations evolved. However, once we
            settled on a concrete solution and shared a sitemap with all
            stakeholders, it became clear that further complexity would only
            delay deadlines and increase resource consumption. This realization
            helped us define the project scope, allowing us to finally conclude
            the research phase and move forward with the development of the app.

        </ProjectPara>
        <ProjectPara title="Design System">
          <p>
            Since the project was government-funded, a significant amount of
            time was spent on background research and processes. After a month
            of research and presenting findings to the clients, I sat on the
            drawing board. I began by establishing the design system, selecting
            Bright Teal as the primary brand color. This choice was based on its
            universal association with health and wellness, aligning with the
            website’s branding concept.
            <br />
            <br />
            The secondary color, Yellow Peach, was chosen as a triadic
            complementary color to enhance the branding. Additionally, two
            accent colors were selected to represent the app’s diversity, state
            indicators, and a contrasting monochrome set for better readability.
            For typography, I opted for Lexend, a modern and sleek font that
            ensures clarity and accessibility.
            <br />

            alt="color-typography"
            title="Color and Typography"
          />
          <p>
            I chose two types of elevations for this project, ensuring a
            balanced visual hierarchy. Following standard design practices, a
            4px spacing system was implemented for consistency. Additionally, I
            opted for rounded buttons to create a more approachable and
            user-friendly interface. Combined with the use of drawn
            illustrations, these design choices help convey a sense of
            friendliness and support throughout the app.
            <br />
          </p>
          <Image
            src="/songjog/design-system-2.png"

            title="Elevation & spacing"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            For the layout, we decided that a four-column grid system would work
            best, maintaining 16 px of margin on both side. Additionally, a 10px
            gutter was used within the grids. While an 8px multiple is often a
            standard choice, it felt too congested for this design. The 10px
            gutter provided a better balance between spacing and content
            density, enhancing readability and usability. <br />
            <br />
            The logo design went through multiple iterations. Initially, I aimed
            for an abstract approach, incorporating props to signify local
            associations. However, after discussions with the clients, I refined
            the concept into something more relatable for users. <br />
            <br />
            The final design visually represents two figures—one symbolizing the
            caregiver and the other as the care receiver. Between them, three
            supporting hearts convey support and empathy. I’m particularly
            pleased that I managed to integrate all these elements within a
            single circular shape, creating a more cohesive and unified logo.

            The core and the most focused feature of the application is Care
            Appointments, allowing users to book services based on their
            preferred time, date, or a custom schedule. Since caregiver
            availability isn't directly tracked by the system, an alternative
            approach was implemented—users can browse available caregivers and
            specify their preferred choice during the confirmation call.
            <br />
            <br />
            To enhance user convenience, active caregivers were highlighted with
            a dedicated card on both the Home and Care list screens.
            Additionally, a Bookings tab was designed to display the history of
            appointments, allowing users to review past bookings, re-book
            services, or leave feedback on their experience.

            Courses were categorized by levels of expertise and included a
            dedicated screen displaying lessons, descriptions, and prior
            reviews. Live courses featured a marker indicating the number of
            attendees. Once any user purchases a course, they receive a
            notification and can access it from either the Explore Courses or
            Subscription screen. Additionally, the progress of ongoing courses
            is always visible on both screens and is tracked using the "Mark as

            efficiently. <br />

            The training sessions were only available to users who registered as
            caregiver trainees (marked by a trainee badge on their profile).
            Once registered, training courses were unlocked and tracked by the
            system. When a user completes a training they would be ranked by
            Level badges. <br />
            <br />
            Since most training sessions and materials were conducted live, they
            did not require a structured course outline. However, users could
            access details of what they would learn and a list of relevant
            documents once they purchased a training session. Similar to
            courses, the training progress would be displayed to users in the
            Subscription screen. Upon successfully completing the training with
            a sufficient score, trainees received a certificate, which they
            could access once the training was finished. <br />
