            The objective of this project was to create a seamless experience
            for writing. Providing various modes and pointing out the outlines

            Now coming into the genre of casual writing software, most of the
            users have been known to choose a particular software over
            "Microsoft Word" is for better{" "}

              writability, speed, and ease of access

            . Yet due to most of the writing tool's bulk and excessive settings
            somehow people get overwhelmed. In this case, the basic wanted
            outcome is to create a minimalistic app while keeping a pretty handy
            level of features and usage.

            So, for opting into this project I needed to understand what are the
            core things that people want to prioritize in their writing tools.
            Firstly a <span className=" text-matchaBase">small audit</span> is
            required to check out what the other tools and platforms offer. A
            few articles in medium would also help us to catch a few customer
            personas. Then After listing the functionalities we can incorporate
            them into our designs.
            <br />
            <br />
            We need to be intuitive about the interfaces and how the
            functionalities interact and follow each other. Finally, design the
            components to format in the prototype.

        <ProjectPara title="Research">
          <p className="text-[#474747]">
            As per the research plans, I first audited the other text editors'
            features. So, I sought 6 to 8 applications and listed out the most
            make-or-break features that they offered with respect to the
            customers and their documents. The most important feature that was
            provided by them were,
            <br />- Outlines <br />- Document details <br />- Markdown support{" "}
            <br />- Hemmingway mode

            <p className="text-[#474747]">
              Following that, I conducted interviews with content writers,
              gathering feedback on features that support them and identifying
              areas that could be improved. I translated this data into an
              affinity map.

              Marketplace analysis
            </h5>
            <p className="text-[#474747]">
              The next thing is what the marketplace users require and what they
              need. In these sorts of writing tools, the users want a seamless
              experience in editing documents. This means any sort of clutter on
              the screen is going to be an issue. Therefore a mode of less Ui
              would be necessary. Secondly, a mode of statistics in the document
              is always very helpful for the user. Breaking the document into
              readability and grammatical correctness to give a full analysis of
              the text should be a really good plus point. Different language
              support is absolutely necessary but coding in the grammatical
              analysis for each and every language would be a very
              hard-to-achieve task. <br />
              <br /> Alongside all of this, the highlight and external link
              support are very useful as users mention. The highlights could be
              incorporated in the outline to provide a thorough fragmentation of
              the document. In the end, the folder structure of the document
              must be upfront to the user as he/she can edit multiple documents
              side by side concurrently.

            As a straightforward text editor Beditor needed to support a highly
            customizable Document space and auxiliary tools. To enhance the
            writing experience, I introduced a dedicated title space and
            multiple section-based markdown components. The editor supports
            different modesâReading, Writing, and Commentingâalong with a robust
            formatting section for text styling and highlighting. <br /> <br />
            On the left sidebar, users can manage local files to locate and edit
            documents. This section can be switched to display the document
            Outline via tabs, allowing for better organization. For seamless
            collaboration, a share button lets users invite contributors, while
            cloud storage and archiving are conveniently placed in the top-right
            corner.

          />
          <p>
            In the bottom-right corner, a document statistics panel provides
            insights into text details and complexity. In writing mode, sections
            can be dragged and rearranged, automatically reflecting in the
            document outline. The Outline itself can be structured into
            chapters, offering writers better subdivision and organization. Text
            editing is done inline with an overlay formatter, making it easy to
            maintain flowâespecially for long-term writing projects.

            A grammar correction feature was introduced based on overwhelming
            user feedback from surveys. It detects and corrects both spelling
            and grammatical errors, ensuring a smoother writing process. <br />
            <br />
            Beditor also includes several modals for key functionalities. The
            color selection modal allows users to choose font colors and
            highlights. Another modal, accessible via the comment button or
            inline formatting, simplifies adding and managing comments. The
            sharing modal enables users to generate a publicly accessible link
            and invite collaborators, making teamwork more efficient.
