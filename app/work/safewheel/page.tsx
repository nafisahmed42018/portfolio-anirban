  overview:
    "Healthcare is a daunting task. For many, it's difficult to focus on medicene, physicians or even healthy lifestyles especially in Bangladesh. The complexities of the healthcare system, coupled with socio-economic factors, often create barriers to prioritizing one's well-being. But, healthcare is not just about medicine and treatment - it's also about information and connection. That's what safewheel intends to create a super app that connects existing healthcare platforms under one roof, providing users with quick and easy access to the information and services. Safewheel should be caring and more humane.",

            When I first visited the SafeWheel headquarters, I was acquainted to
            the old site. In addition, the team presented several ideas for
            rebranding and enhancing the website. From our ethnographic survey,
            we came up with a st of user stories that would be helpful to at
            least start this revolutionary journey of developing a comprehensive
            one-stop healthcare application. <br />

            After completing this step, the process began to diverge into
            different routes. While juggling various responsibilities, I
            gathered ideas from different sources. The development team
            initiated decisions on the technologies to be employed. Ultimately,
            we concluded that the new website should be built from scratch.{" "}

            At the start of the brand guideline was chaos. There were far too
            many options to choose from and marketing was all over the place and
            lacked cohesion. It was really important to have a concrete and
            clear brand identity. Addressing the ambiguity in colors, I
            implemented a 4-depth color system, carefully selecting primary and
            secondary colors to bring clarity and consistency to the brand.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            Green was chosen for its association with safety and well-being, a
            fitting representation for the healthcare sector in the design.
            Blue, selected as a monochrome neutral color, provides accent and
            contrast to the background white. It symbolizes knowledge and
            reliability, enhancing the overall visual appeal.

            In selecting a font for typography, I sought one commonly used in

            versatile choice, communicating a mix of modernity and
            sophistication. Our design aimed for a powerful visual impact, and
            Metropolis delivered. To maintain cohesion with our developers'
            familiarity, we structured spacing using the Tailwind CSS spacing
            system. <br />

            These pieces then came together to shape how users navigate through
            the system. To keep everything consistent, we stuck to the same

            generics were removed to optimize space utilization. External
            buttons were replaced with a prominent blog component, ensuring that
            new users immediately recognize the availability of a comprehensive
            health information blog upon joining the application. <br />
            <br />
            The search bar was design to be as prominent as possible. The
            indexes had a consistent look and feel while clearly indicating the
            price of the product. An additional marketing space was allocated at
            the search index page for a proportionate look. <br />

            In our market analysis, we noticed that companies simplified their

            on-site benefits like wallet credits and coupons.

          <p>
            Browsing on the previous website was meticulous and boring. We
            needed to introduce attention-grabbing elements and variations in
            products to keep users engaged. <br />
            <br />
            Although keeping customers engaged within an application is a dark
            side of UX, it's evident that medicines aren't the type of products
            users are inclined to browse for hours. Since we have a lot more to
            offer than just medicines, it's crucial to portray our complete
            services through quirky banners and intriguing offers. <br />
            <br />
            The product page featured alternative medicines for user selection.
            Product details were revamped with appropriate and aesthetically
            pleasing icons, and product variants were upgraded to a more
            visually appealing tab view. <br />
            I observed that when users scroll down the page, the price details
            get lost. To address this, a bottom sheet was added to the page,
            ensuring users can view their price details at all times. <br />

            data to work with and the execution was inconvenient. <br />
            <br />
            After a thorough review, I created cards for each entry to display
            essential details and incorporated buttons for accessing the details
            page and tracking the order status in real-time. The re-order
            feature was added to the details page, redirecting users to the
            cart, not the checkout, allowing them to edit and add items to the
            order again. <br />

            The wallet, also known as SafeCash, was a highly ambitious feature.
            It operated on its own credit system directly linked to user
            expenses. Cashback, refunds, and discounts were seamlessly
            integrated into the wallet. Furthermore, it included an agent scheme
            allowing withdrawals in real currency. <br />
            <br />
            Following is the complete model of the wallet decide by UX
            perspective. <br />

            The blog was designed to be straightforward with detailed and
            informative content. Its well-organized design is easy to
            understand. A featured section on the blog homepage highlights the
            most popular posts. Additionally, a comment section has been
            incorporated on the blog post page, enabling users to leave
            comments.

            Design handover posed a challenge for this project, given the
            relatively young age of the developers and the sheer size of the
            project, making it difficult to track in one view. I addressed this
            by exporting views onto Zeplin and prototyping the entire
            application in InVision. Each skeleton and component were
            individually extracted and presented to the developers. The
            application was ultimately built with Flutter, for both native and
            iOS platforms. <br />
            <br />
            Approximately 85% of the design was successfully implemented in the
            application, with 75% for the website. User feedback played a
            crucial role in refining and iterating the design further,
            contributing to a highly successful execution. <br />

              It was inspiring to witness how each person brought a unique
              perspective to the table during the sketching sessions. I observed
              that non-technical individuals unleash limitless ideas due to
              their lack of technical constraints, while technical minds provide
              a grounded perspective, serving as a valuable sounding board for
              what is realistically achievable.

              This proactive approach minimizes the need for rework later on, as
              an upfront understanding of technical limitations informs and
              shapes the design strategy.

              At the end of the day, you are addressing the pains of your users,
              so keeping their needs at the forefront is crucial. It's easy to
              lose sight of this when immersed in day-to-day tasks.
