              I have always been interested in artworks and structures. All the
              manmade and the god-given natural entities enthralled me. Colors
              intrigued me. The geometric shapes, the way they are filled in
              with depths and textures, and the way each separate person
              arranges them; They bound to have a purpose. I have to say,
              finding order and patterns in certain places, ground-binding
              architectures, and interaction between people always made me
              think…
            </p>
            <div className="flex flex-col items-start justify-center font-medium text-[17px] leading-[26px]">
              <p>- How do these physical proportions come together?</p>
              <p>- How do they form and attain order?</p>
              <p>- And what makes one piece unfit for the ecosystem?</p>
            </div>
          </div>

            Later down the line, this curiosity led me to start writing. During
            my time at my university, I used to write articles or stories about
            people and inanimate objects. Sketching up their roles into the
            environment they belong to. Traversing through this path I figured
            out a certain thing in me. The problems we see in our real life and
            however they are occurring, do actually have a reason of
            significance. Each and every human has a reason to do or want
            something out of a situation. And I for once wanted to get to the
            bottom of it. Learn to know about the problem’s architectures and
            affiliate me in a better way of achieving possible successful
            outcomes.

            Now as I was doing my bachelor's in software engineering, I thought
            about a way to work through this within my career. During the
            pandemic, there were a few free times in my hand when I started to
            learn about the{' '}
            <span className=" font-medium text-monochrome110">
              User Experience culture
            </span>{' '}
            and became very interested in it. Getting myself familiarized with
            human centric narratives soon has driven me to find answers and
            connections amongst the world around us.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the end all I can say is that I am in love with UX. Because, I
            believe in the{' '}
            <span className=" font-medium text-monochrome110">
              reasoning and the flow
            </span>{' '}
            of structured entities.{' '}
            <span className=" font-medium text-monochrome110">
              I believe, progress relies in acceptance and actions.
            </span>{' '}
            And through different perspective we are sure to achieve better
            results.
