          Prior to my UX journey, I was adorned into front-end Development. It
          was there that I realized how crucial it is for contents and elements
          to seamlessly connect and guide users.{' '}
          <span className=" font-medium text-matchaBase">
            It is the breath of the users' journey{' '}
          </span>
          and makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scouring through multiple media I came close to designing. Modeling my
          very own personalized products, and the ability to create became a
          source of fascination for me.

        <p className=" font-medium text-matchaBase text-[16px] leading-[24px]">
          The things I've done so far are a pursuit to relate to people, their
          conscious choices, and their ease and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as a designer I'm looking for just a group of people whom I can
          explore these ideas and grow.
